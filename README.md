# Video Playlist

## Local Setup

## Stack

### Front-End

HTML, SCSS, BEM class naming convention (partially), JavaScript and Angular 1.

### Back-End

Node.js, Express.

### Development

gulp, git, GitHub, insomnia.

## Process

1. Fleshed out wireframe.

2. Defined MVP features.
3. Created express web server to serve static files.
4. Built wireframe in HTML and CSS.
5. Created backend API and database.
6. Created front-end JS to make API requests and update UI.
7. Adopted a new design direction.
8. Adapted the component to these designs in HTML, SCSS and JS.
9. Build on the new radial progress bar and make it my own.

### 1. Wireframes

Although simple wireframes were provided in the brief for this project I prefer to have a more detailed idea of the final aesthetic  and design of my apps before I start development. I find having a clear target helps when constructing the app and completing the initial styling.

Given the time constraints of the project I decided to cherry pick features and styling ques from existing mobile video sites (e.g BBC iPlayer). I used pintrest to facilitate this comparison.

From those pins I liked how iPlayer and 4od have the first video in the playlist larger than the others. I also liked the player which had a title and gradient overlay on top of the thumbnails (both below).

I used balasmiq to create a single wire frame which I think should be enough, paired with the provided wireframes, to begin building the app.

### 2. Features

### 2.1 MVP

- Video index page and show pages which follow the theme of the above wireframe.
- All video controls will be provided by Youtube embedded or similar.

The above must be built with a mobile first approach, be cross browser compatible (2 versions back), make consideration for accessibility guidelines.

The app must also be deployed to heroku.

### 2.2 Nice to Have

- Landing page / slick animation to index page.
- Search functionality.
- Pagination.

### 4. Wireframes in HTML and CSS

### 5. Express API

### 6. Angular Front-end

### 7. More Detailed Designs

### 8. Implementing New Design

### 9. Making It My Own

## Known Issues To Be Addressed
